* Why are we doing this?
The point of this exercise is to create a fully functional CRUD application which displays some of the key programming concepts learned over the course of the bootcamp.  

* How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to be easier to execute than it turned out to be, getting basic functionality was fairly straight forward, however elevating the project was more difficult than initially anticipated. 

* What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I found it relatively straight forward to apply the AGILE methodology and found it very useful for planning and tracking progress, however the testing portion of the exercise fell short of my targets and was not something I budgeted enough time for. I also spent a longer time debugging what I initially expected to be fairly simple code to write but which ultimately took a lot longer than anticipated to conduct. So in all I think better planning in the initial stages would have served to improve the final product.

* Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
In future I would budget at least double, if not triple the time I assigned for testing. Some of the key concepts of testing are something I definitely need to revisit, and having read further into the topic, I think perhaps a test driven approach would be something I would utilise for future projects. I would also be more ambitious in terms of the functionality of the application, as I would have liked to include the DTOs to add a rudimentary battle function to the application. ![Test Results and Coverage Report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98532877/160125508-a8c5f8cd-6cb5-4a31-8ccb-2a61cb12d61d.png)
